analysis of supreme court decisions 1946-2017

Repo to store work on answering Andre Torrez's question in Opening Arguments 311:
"My thesis is that the distribution of Supreme Court decisions can be mathematically shown to have changed demonstrably beginning in the 1980â€™s and then beginning sharply with the Roberts Court in 2007, and I would love to see our listeners kind of tackle that project and show that we have moved from a Supreme Court that has more 9-0 opinions to a Supreme Court that is pushing decisions towards the 5-4"
